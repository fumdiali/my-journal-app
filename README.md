# My Journal App
![alt text](journalapp.png "Screenshot of landing screen")
This is my attempt for the 7 Days of code challenge - ALCWithGoogle 3.0
As per project instructions - 
Application Functions:
At minimum users should be able to:
 1.Register and Login using google authentication.
 2.View all entries to their diary.
 3.View the contents of a diary entry.
 4.Add and modify an entry.
I affirm that feature 1 is incomplete.

Minimal implementation: 
User taps on CREATE ACCOUNT button, and gets directed to Google's 
account creation page. Post successful creation, user may return
to app and sign-in with the Google sign-in button.
NOTE: This feature is incomplete, as there is NO AUTHENTICATION feature
set.
