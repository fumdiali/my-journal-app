# My Journal App
![alt text](journalapp.png "Screenshot of landing screen")<br/>
This is my attempt at the 7 Days of code challenge - ALCWithGoogle 3.0

As per project instructions :-<br/> 
<br/>
At minimum users should be able to:<br/>
 1.Register and Login using google authentication.<br/>
 2.View all entries to their diary.<br/>
 3.View the contents of a diary entry.<br/>
 4.Add and modify an entry.<br/>
I affirm that feature 1 is incomplete.<br/>

User is prompted to add entries on empty screen
![alt text](home-screen.png "Screenshot of home screen")<br/>
Minimal implementation: 
User taps on CREATE ACCOUNT button, and gets directed to Google's 
account creation page. Post successful creation, user may return
to app and sign-in with the Google sign-in button.
NOTE: This feature is incomplete, as there is NO AUTHENTICATION feature
set.
<br/>
Dialog box gives user means of adding journal entry and saving it<br/>

Entries are modifiable(Edit/Delete)<br/>
![alt text](delete-screen.png "delete entry screen")<br/>
![alt text](edit-entry.png "Screenshot of screen")<br/>

Entries are displayed<br/>

There's a settings option intended<br/>
![alt text](settings-menu.png "launch settings screen")<br/>

User may customize app appearance(un-implemented)<br/>

Over all, the basic app functionalities(excluding authentication) were attempted successfully.
