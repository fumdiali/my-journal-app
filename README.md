# My Journal App
![alt text](journalapp.png "Screenshot of landing screen")
This is my attempt at the 7 Days of code challenge - ALCWithGoogle 3.0

As per project instructions -\n 
Application Functions:\n
At minimum users should be able to:\n
 1.Register and Login using google authentication.\n
 2.View all entries to their diary.\n
 3.View the contents of a diary entry.\n
 4.Add and modify an entry.\n
I affirm that feature 1 is incomplete.\n

User is prompted to add entries on empty screen

Minimal implementation: 
User taps on CREATE ACCOUNT button, and gets directed to Google's 
account creation page. Post successful creation, user may return
to app and sign-in with the Google sign-in button.
NOTE: This feature is incomplete, as there is NO AUTHENTICATION feature
set.

Dialog box gives user means of adding journal entry and saving it

Entries are modifiable(Edit/Delete)
![alt text](delete-screen.png "delete entry screen")
![alt text](edit-entry.png "Screenshot of screen")

Entries are displayed

There's a settings option intended

User may customize app appearance(un-implemented)

Over all, the basic app functionalities(excluding authentication) were attempted successfully.
